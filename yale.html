        </h3>

        <p>
            Most of these projects involved collaboration with multiple clients
            or stakeholders. The projects spawned multiple months and phases.
        </p>

        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Created several JAX-RS based services such as an archival
                content export service (for ArchivesSpace). The export service
                conducts content change analysis to determine which metadata files
                have changed since the last export.
                The program also applies several stylesheets to validate
                and transform MODS files. This service prevented the need to update
                the full multi-million object collection (instead of just a few objects).
                It's been designed as a part of a larger effort to automate
                metadata publishing.
              </li>
              <li>Created a SOAP-based persistent identifier management service
                that was used by many departments. It used
                Apache Axis for JAX-WS. The service
                allowed machine-to-machine bulk
                <a href="https://www.handle.net/">handle</a> creation, and a
                JSP/Servlets-based GUI was also created to facilitate
                testing and spreadsheet export. This service was one of the very
                first projects launched by the Office of Digital Assets and Infrastructure,
                and it was critical for this project to succeed as it involved
                multiple client departments. Millions of
                handles were created by his service. (A
                different version of this service exists now). After the project
                launch, my team's director at ITS kindly acknowledged my efforts:

                <p>

                <blockquote> Great work, Osman!  Always nice to be recognized - and this is a great example of
                how our team can contribute to the creation of important institutional services. . . </blockquote>

              </p>

            </li>
            <li>
                Created a central logging service to help build error stats and
                visualizations (for apps like Tableau). After experimenting with other solutions,
                I introduced Splunk as an alternative to this service. I'm also
                implementing message-oriented solutions (using JMS) to connect disparate systems.
            </li>
            <li>
                Helped create an application for exporting the contents of a large
                storage repository. The service
                exported content using the BagIt format and relied on a MySql
                database to track progress. JAXB was used for marshalling/
                unmarshalling XML/objects from metadata schemas such as MODS
                and CDWA Lite.

                A long time ago, I launched the PHP-based Ross Archive of African Images
                collection (developed by an external vendor), and enabled audio streaming
                using QuickTime, RTSP and MacOS X Server for an
                international collection (now offline).

        </h3>

        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Before using Canvas, Yale used to heavily rely on <a
                    href="https://sakaiproject.org/">Sakai</a> as the
                primary learning management system. I helped extend the
                Java-based <a
                        href="https://confluence.sakaiproject.org/display/SIGNUP/Home">Sign-up
                    tool</a>, a core
                Sakai tool
                that helps organize meetings. I also created services to export
                content and change forum permissions.
                Modifying these
                tools and services involved working with the Sakai API, JSF,
                JAX-WS, Spring and Hibernate.
            </li>
            <li>Maintained SharePoint (used by library staff
                for workflows and content management) intermittently.
                Successfully installed
                and migrated a complex enterprise instance
                from a failing

        </h3>

        <p>

        <ul>
            <li>Created a JSF/Hibernate web application that helps staff manage inventory.
                Students scan books in library stacks, and the program generates a report
                that shows books that are shelved out of order, etc.
                The webapp allows a user to store and search reports,
                and it also allows students to track their scanning sessions. I
                worked closely with a business analyst and a graduate student to develop
                the business logic.
                This application is used by many Yale libraries (and perhaps
                even at UConn), and it was presented at two official events.
                <!-- <img id="shelfscan" src="shelfscan3.png" alt="shelfscan" width="300"/></li> -->
                <li>Created "bulk cataloging" application with several features: import/export,
                    cron management, asynchronous processing, notifications,
                    versioning, etc. The Java-based project used
                    Quartz,
                    JAX-RS, JSF, and Hibernate. (The project is currently on hold.)
                </li>
            <li>Created a Swing bulk folder transfer application with
                start/stop functionality and a backend indexing
                service.
                The service is used by photographers to transfer images.
            </li>
            <li>
              Created a PHP-interface for a multi-institutional (Michigan,
              UCSD, Yale) topic modelling research project. The application allowed
              students to enter labels for documents.
            </li>
            <li>Designed simple UI for these applications using Bootstrap,
                jQuery, etc.:

        </h3>

        <p>
        <ul>

            <li>Contributed performance improvements to prominent Hydra-based <a
                    href="http://findit.library.yale.edu/">collections</a> by
                    identifying code-related bottlenecks. Specifically,
                    looking at relevant log files (and with the help of New Relic),
                    I found that Solr itself was returning results
                    relatively fast (200-660ms for all documents, 1-2 msec for a particular object),
                    but 90% of the time was getting spent in Blacklight-related logic
                    (method “index” in a "CatalogController", e.g.), possibly
                    due to complicated parent-child logic. If the initial Solr query to get the 10 search results
                    was being made at t=0 seconds, the next one, to get the first object,
                    was being made around t=1 seconds later. A loop with 10 objects, representing
                    a page with 10 results, therefore, took almost 6-8 seconds.

                    <p>
                    I also observed other coding issues.
                    For example, there were frequently called methods
                    that loaded up configuration
                    files every time
                    they were invoked. I also found out the reason
                    the landing page loaded in 60-90 seconds (after a user
                    got redirected from the authentication layer):
                    the code was making an unnecessary call to an unkempt
                    user table with hundreds and thousands of rows. </p>
            </li>
            <!-- <li>Analyzed and refactored IT tests</li> -->

            <li>Analyzed Solr configuration to identify potential performance
                bottlenecks. I found out that we could not balance our Solr
                ingest and query speeds well because of some gem versions
                we were using. Specifically, the gem "hydra-head-6.0.0"
                (and thus ActiveFedora) was making hard commits, thereby creating
                the observed conflict between ingest and user search (ActiveFedora
                changed its hard committing behavior in later versions).
