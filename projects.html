            Contribution Analysis Tool
        </h3>

        <p>
            The project was concerned with objectively analyzing a student’s quantifiable
            contributions to team projects.
            The contention motivating the project was that accurately evaluating student
            contributions is an important pedagogical
            task that an instructor must not leave to guesswork. </p>

            <img src="cat-screenshot.png" alt="contrib analysis tool" width="600">

      <p>
          The tool uses software quality metrics and other VCS-related activity
          to measure the quality and quantity of student contributions. The
          project <a href="cat.pdf">report</a> covers some details of how the tool makes this happen.
      </p>

      <p>
          Some of the pertinent features of the application are: (a) integration with external
          build systems; (b) authentication and authorization; (c) visual comparison of student
          performances; (d) bulk data import; and (e) data export.
      </p>

        <p>
            On an architectural level, the application
            was implemented as a modular application, thereby making it possible to allow relevant
            analysis plugins
            to be customized, added and removed. The project also relied on open source libraries and software
            such as PrimeFaces (JSF library), JSF (MVC), Apache Maven (Java build tool), Apache
            Tomcat (servlet container), Apache Derby (embedded relational database), JUnit (unit
            testing framework), and Jenkins.
        </p>

        <p>
            The tool does not download and run the
            builds itself, but relays this
            task to Jenkins, a popular open-source continuous-integration (CI) server.
            As a student makes commits to a project, Jenkins runs
            various plugins as part of the build process and provides relevant statistics via a
            RESTful API. The web application leverages these APIs to analyze and summarize
            student activity.
        </p>

        <p>
            As the report suggests, automating contribution analysis has several benefits:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Gathering insights into student behavior by looking at how effective
              participation relates to final grades.
            <li>Identifying "troubled" relationships by getting alerts for teams that exhibit an
                imbalance in their participation score.
            <li>Grading teams uniformly.
            <li>Allowing a student to more easily report any ``free-riders" in a project.
        </ul>

            using Particle and Kalman Filters
        </h3>

        <p>Using Kalman filters, extended Kalman filter (EKF), k-Nearest Neighbors, and
            particle filters</a>,
            I worked with other team members on tackling a motion prediction problem of a "micro robot",
            and I implemented several approaches such as EKF. <a href="https://www.hexbug.com/nano">HEXBUG
                Nano</a> is a "micro robotic creature" that propels forward and
            explores its environment by using the physics of its vibration.
            The goal was to predict its motion given a history of its trajectories.
            The best results were achieved
            with particle filters and a simple motion model.
          </p>
          <p>
            I wrote and organized most of the project report</a>;
           from a pool of 50+ team submissions, the report was selected as one of the best reports (4 in all).</p>

        <!-- Project 4 -->

        <h3>
            <a id="project4" class="anchor" href="#project4" aria-hidden="true">

            Scheduler
        </h3>

        <p>Created a Java based course scheduler system using integer programming with the <a
                href="http://www.gurobi.com/">Gurobi</a>
            optimization library. The program uses different criteria (number of students, available
            instructors, etc.) to
            try to come up with an optimal scheduling solution (assigning students to classes
            based on instructor and TA availability, etc).</p>

        <p>
            The application was implemented as a 3-tier web application. The functionality was separated
            into different modules to avoid a monolithic application. Like some academic IT
            applications written in Java (e.g., Sakai),
            the architecture/design was loosely based on Java EE. JavaServer Faces (JSF) framework
            was used to realize the MVC front-end layer. Hibernate, as a Java Persistence API (JPA)
            implementation, was chosen as the ORM framework.
        </p>

        <p>

            Choosing a n(3)-tier architecture and a Java EE based stack proved to be a "good enough"
            choice (sufficient for an A and an offer of TAship for the course). The architecture
            indirectly allows horizontal scaling (with a data grid cluster, for instance).
            For large-scale production-use optimization problems, however, a truly distributed component architecture
            would have been a better choice.
            This possibility was not explored due to time constraints, but I hope to create a
            different implementation in future (using Scala and Akka perhaps).

        </h3>
        <p>As part of a systems course, I created a C-based userspace thread and mutex library (as an alternative to NPTL).
            The preemptive round robin scheduler works on a queue of threads to be scheduled. Needless to say,
            this was a challenging and rewarding project.
        </p>
        <p>
            The thread and mutex API looks like the following: </p>
                                  <pre>
void thread_init(long period);
int  thread_create(thread_t *thread;
void *(*start_routine)(void *),void *arg);
int  thread_join(thread_t thread, void **status);
void thread_exit(void *retval);
int  thread_yield(void);
int  thread_equal(thread_t t1, thread_t t2);
int  thread_cancel(thread_t thread);
thread_t thread_self(void);
thread_mutex_init(thread_mutex_t *mutex);
int  thread_mutex_lock(thread_mutex_t *mutex);
int  thread_mutex_unlock(thread_mutex_t *mutex);
          </pre>

                      Application
                  </h3>

                  <p>The project’s goal was to build an object classification system by utilizing <a
                          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale-invariant_feature_transform">SIFT</a> for feature detection
                          and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model_in_computer_vision">Visual Bag of Words</a> model.
                      The work combined computational photography (specifically, feature detection) with
                      machine learning (classification and clustering). </p>

                  <p>A use case is an application which detects unwanted or dangerous objects, such
                      as liquid containers on shelves, in images captured by a robot. A robot could capture
                      photos of each shelf in a facility and then periodically compare the images to the
                      original (or recent) images. The robot might even be a small drone (ideally with
                      autonomous flying capability) or a rover with navigation capabilities. </p>

                  <p>There can different types of unwanted objects and shelving errors, so it is desirable to
                      not "hardcode" which objects are deemed "dangerous." Hence, machine learning. </p>

                  <p>A BoW model represents an object (e.g., image of a human face) as a histogram over its
                      regions or features (e.g., eyes, nose, ears, etc). Csurka et al. (in their 2004 paper)
                      demonstrated a BoW model to distinguish between examples of photos of books, cars, trees
                      people, etc.  </p>

                  <p>The tool detects suspicious items such as those shown below. Note that there were around 20% false
                      positives (which really is the state of the art with simple Visual BoW approaches).
